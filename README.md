# My-UVIndex
This is a Node.js app made with the Express framework that finds the user's current local UV index and other predicted factors as returned from API requests made to [OpenUV](https://www.openuv.io/dashboard) with Axios. The [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript) was embedded into this application to allow users to select locations interactively and retrieve coordinates. This application follows RESTful principles.
